# Crowdfunding-ETL
## Overview
For this project, we are working with Independent Funding, a crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects or ventures. They have provided us with a new dataset that contains information about the backers who’ve pledged to the live projects and want us to perform both an ETL process on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries. We will use Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, we will extract and transform the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. We then do the load phase by using the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. And, we will upload the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. Finally, we will perform a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
